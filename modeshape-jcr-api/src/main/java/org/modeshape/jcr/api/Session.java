     * ImportUUIDBehavior#IMPORT_UUID_CREATE_NEW}: Incoming nodes are added in
     * the same way that new node is added with <code>Node.addNode</code>. That
     * is, they are either assigned newly created identifiers upon addition or
     * upon <code>save</code> (depending on the implementation, see <i>4.9.1.1
     * When Identifiers are Assigned</i> in the specification). In either case,
     * identifier collisions will not occur. </li> <li> {@link
     * ImportUUIDBehavior#IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_REMOVE_EXISTING}: If an incoming
     * node has the same identifier as a node already existing in the workspace
     * then the already existing node (and its subgraph) is removed from
     * wherever it may be in the workspace before the incoming node is added.
     * Note that this can result in nodes "disappearing" from locations in the
     * workspace that are remote from the location to which the incoming
     * subgraph is being written. Both the removal and the new addition will be
     * dispatched on <code>save</code>. </li> <li> {@link
     * ImportUUIDBehavior#IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_REPLACE_EXISTING}: If an
     * incoming node has the same identifier as a node already existing in the
     * workspace, then the already-existing node is replaced by the incoming
     * node in the same position as the existing node. Note that this may result
     * in the incoming subgraph being disaggregated and "spread around" to
     * different locations in the workspace. In the most extreme case this
     * behavior may result in no node at all being added as child of
     * <code>parentAbsPath</code>. This will occur if the topmost element of the
     * incoming XML has the same identifier as an existing node elsewhere in the
     * workspace. The change will be dispatched on <code>save</code>. </li> <li>
     * {@link ImportUUIDBehavior#IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_THROW}: If an incoming
     * node has the same identifier as a node already existing in the workspace
     * then an <code>ItemExistsException</code> is thrown. </li> </ul> Unlike
     * {@link Workspace#importXML}, this method does not necessarily enforce all
     * node type constraints during deserialization. Those that would be
     * immediately enforced in a normal write method (<code>Node.addNode</code>,
     * <code>Node.setProperty</code> etc.) of this implementation cause an
     * immediate <code>ConstraintViolationException</code> during
     * deserialization. All other constraints are checked on <code>save</code>,
     * just as they are in normal write operations. However, which node type
     * constraints are enforced depends upon whether node type information in
     * the imported data is respected, and this is an implementation-specific
     * issue.
     * <p>
     * A <code>ConstraintViolationException</code> will also be thrown
     * immediately if <code>uuidBehavior</code> is set to
     * <code>IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_REMOVE_EXISTING</code> and an incoming node
     * has the same identifier as the node at <code>parentAbsPath</code> or one
